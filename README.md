Additionally at this point, my JS file in this commit may look like a whole lot was deleted and then added,
but this is mostly the same stuff. I kept having issues because much of what I did was happening in DOMContentLoaded
which meant I had issues with things not being defined. I figured the best I could do was completely rework the whole
thing.
